# BIDS-compatible template

This repository contains files that provide a template specification for the PLAY project's datasets/volumes, sessions, and measures. 
The specification is inspired by and intended to be compatible with the [Brain Imaging Data Structure (BIDS)](http://bids.neuroimaging.io).

There are some modifications that make the specification compatible with the Databrary data model.
